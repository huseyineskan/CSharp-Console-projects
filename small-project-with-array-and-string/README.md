# 🧵 Small Project with Array and Strings

In this project, I implemented an example of how to loop over strings in an array and how to split strings.

---

## ❓ How It Works

1. We enter string elements into the array.
2. We work on all elements of the array with foreach and if there is a period (.) in the string, we put it into a while loop.

---

## 🔁 Functions used

- ✅ foreach()
- ✅ while()
- ✅ Remove()
- ✅ Substring()
- ✅ Trim() and TrimStart()
- ✅ IndexOf()

---

## 📁 Sample Example

```
string[] myStrings = new string[2] { "I like pizza. I like roast chicken. I like salad", "I like all tree of the menu choices" };
```

Output:

```
I like pizza
I like roast chicken
I like salad
I like all tree of the menu choices
```

## 👨‍💻 Features that can be added

- Getting array elements from the user.
- Getting the character to be used for parsing strings from the user.
