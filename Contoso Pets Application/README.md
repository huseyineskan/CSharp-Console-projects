# Contoso Pets Application

## 📋 Description

Contoso Pets Application is a simple console-based C# project that allows users to:

- Add a new pet
- List all pets
- Edit a pet's information
- Delete a pet
- Exit

The project uses basic C# concepts like `List<T>`, `FirstOrDefault()`, `while` loops, and simple input validation.

## ⚙ Technologies Used

- C# (.NET Core Console Application)
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Properties)
- LINQ (FirstOrDefault, RemoveAll)
- Basic input validation (int.TryParse, string checks)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the project in your favorite C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build and run the program.

## Usage

After running the application, you will see the main menu:

```
Welcome to Contoso Pets Application.

-------------- MAIN MENU --------------
1. Add a new pet.
2. List of all pets.
3. Edit pet information.
4. Delete pet.
Exit
```

Select a menu item by typing its number (e.g., `1` to add a new pet) or type `exit` to close the application.

## 📌 Notes

- Typing exit anytime in the menu will terminate the program.
- Input fields cannot be left empty when adding or editing a pet.
- When editing, leaving a field empty keeps the original value.

## Known Missing Features / Future Improvements

- **Input Validation Improvements:**
  - Currently no exception handling if user enters invalid data (e.g., non-numeric age).
- **Search Functionality:**
  - Ability to search pets by name, type, or age.
- **Persistence:**
  - Save pet data to a file or database so it is not lost when the app closes.
- **Refactor into Separate Classes:**
  - Move menu management and pet operations into separate service classes.
- **More Data Fields:**
  - Add fields like adoption status, medical history, etc.
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Add basic unit tests for critical methods.
